      <h2>WHO</h2>
      <em>Grayson Lorenz<br />Lorenz Wood Shop</em>
      <p>
        I am an application developer by day, wood worker... also by day, but on the weekends and evenings. I had always
        wanted a shop of my own, having grown up around folks who always worked with their hands. I made a few things
        around the house like a standing cabinet, a display for some games, and so on.

      <h2>WHAT</h2>
      <em>A crafts person with many hats</em>
      <p>
        I specialize in small wood projects thought have made larger pieces. I make a lot of table top accessories for
        gaming and have enjoyed making pens, pencils, and boxes. I've made furniture for friends and family, and
        continue to learn to do better and better work.

      <h2>WHEN</h2>
      <em>I'm not a master, but I'm not new</em>
      <p>
        I was playing a lot of D&D so I made a dice tray for my self and folks seemed to like it. I made a bunch of
        them, I sold those at a convention, I needed to start a business. I started this woodshop in 2018 and continued
        to do work locally. I learned as I worked, and now I make trays and pens to sell at the local game store.
